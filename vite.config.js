/**
 * GitHub Pages serves static files only — it has no rewrite rule to map client-side
 * routes back to the app shell. So a direct visit to (or a reload of) a route such as
 * /overview or /contributors requests a file that does not exist on disk and Pages
 * returns its default "File not found" page instead of the app.
 *
 * Emitting 404.html as a copy of index.html provides an SPA fallback: Pages serves
 * that file for any unmatched path, the app boots, and React Router resolves the route
 * from window.location. The URL is preserved, so there is no redirect and no flash.
